      THE EA CLASS LIBRARY PACKAGE
      ============================

      This package consists of two classes (EA and EAList) wrapping the
      OS/2 Extended-Attribute APIs. You have to compile and link the
      appropriate files together with your application.

      The implementation needs an IBM C++ compiler, either CSet++ or
      Visual Age C++. Ports to other compilers are welcome and will be
      included in future versions.

      For details and for the license agreement see the User's Guide and
      Reference (and of course, the sources).
